Yields one large serving bowl 

Preparation time: 60-75 minutes

Ingredients - guacamole:

• 9 ripe Haas avocados

• 1 tablespoon salt

• 1 large yellow or Vidalia onion

• 2 tablespoons chopped, seeded jalapenos

• 3 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves

• 3 tomatoes

• Lime juice from three limes (have extra just in case)

• 1⁄2 serving of hot salsa (see separate recipe)

• Salt and pepper to taste • Cumin to taste

• Tostitos Scoops

Ingredients - salsa:

• 4-6 jalapenos

• 1 14-16 ounce can of diced tomatoes - DRAINED WELL

• Cumin (2-3 tablespoons for hot)

• Salt

Tools:

• Mortar and pestle if available

• Blender

Directions - guacamole:

1. Avocado

• Halve the avocados (length wise) and remove the pits

• Use a small knife, slice it into 1/8-inch strips lengthwise and crosswise without slicing through the skin

• Spoon to scoop the avocado out of the peel and into a bowl

2. Paste - using a mortar and pestle (or the flat bottom of a glass), combine the following until it resembles a juice paste:

• 1 tablespoon salt

• 1⁄2 cut of the chopped onion

• 1 tablespoon jalapenos

• 1 tablespoon cilantro

3. Combine the paste mixture with the other ingredients

4. Add the ingredients/paste to the bowl of avocados; mix the ingredients without mashing so the avocados are left semi-firm

Directions - salsa:

1. Boil a medium saucepan of water

2. Add the jalapenos and leave in for 7 minutes, stirring 2-3x

3. Core/Seed the jalapenos

4. In the blender, add: jalapenos, canned tomatoes, cumin and salt

5. Pulse to fold everything – should be 3-5 seconds, taste for seasoning, and 3 more seconds if needs more heat. DO NOT over-pulse

Note:

• If serving with guacamole, make 3 servings of salsa, 2 hot and 1 mild – 1⁄2 hot for the guacamole, the other 2 are served in bowls
