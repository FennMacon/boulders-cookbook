Serves 4 to 6 

Preparation time: 20 minutes

### Ingredients:

• 1 1⁄2 pounds boneless chicken breast - pounded to 1⁄4 inch thick

• 3⁄4 cup all-purpose flour

• 2 to 3 large eggs

• 1 1⁄2 cup Panko crumbs

• 3⁄4 cup seasoned Italian breadcrumbs

• 1⁄4 cup grated Locatelli Pecorino Romano

• 1 tablespoon garlic powder

• 1 tablespoon freshly chopped parsley

• Kosher salt

• Freshly ground pepper

• 10 tablespoons olive oil - divided

### Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees

2. In a shallow bowl, place flour and season with salt and pepper

3. In a 2nd bowl, beat eggs together

4. In a 3rd bowl, combine panko, Locatelli, parsley and garlic powder - salt and pepper to taste

5. Dredge chicken in flour mixture and transfer it to the egg mixture and coat - allow excess to drip back

6. Transfer to panko mixture, press, and coat

7. In a large skillet, heat 6 to 8 tablespoons of oil over medium heat

8. Working in 2 batches, cook cutlets - adding 2 tablespoons of oil between batches until golden brown and cooked through - approximately 5 minutes

Note:

• When going to Maine, prepare chicken cutlets in advance by cooking each side until just golden brown, but not cooked through.
