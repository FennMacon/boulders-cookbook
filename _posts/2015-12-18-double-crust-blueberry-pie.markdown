Serves 8

Preparation time: 90 minutes 

Baking time: 45-50 minutes

Double pie crust ingredients:

• 2 1⁄2 cups all-purpose flour

• 2 sticks salted butter - divide into small pats

• 1⁄4 cup ice water (more if needed)

• Egg wash of 1⁄4 cup heavy cream and 1 egg yolk

Filling ingredients:

• 5 to 6 cups of fresh Maine blueberries (more if using a deep dish)

• 1⁄4 cup tapioca - preferably Kraft Minute Tapioca

• 1 cup sugar

• Food processor

• Parchment paper

• 9 inch pie plate

• Baking sheet

### Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees

2. In a food processor, combine the flour and butter for approximately 20 seconds; butter should break up

3. Add ice water slowly into the tube until the dough holds - no more than 1 minute

4. On parchment paper:

• Divide the batter in half

• Shape into flattened disks

• Refrigerate until cold - 30 to 60 minutes

5. While crust cools, combine all the filling ingredients and let stand for at least 15 minutes

6. Roll out each half so that it fills a 9 inch pie pan; place one half in the pie pan to create the bottom crust

7. Add filling

8. Dot 1 tablespoon of butter on top crust and place over the bottom/filling

9. Coat top crust with egg wash

10. Place pie on baking sheet and bake for 45-50 minutes – until juice bubbles begin to burst slowly
