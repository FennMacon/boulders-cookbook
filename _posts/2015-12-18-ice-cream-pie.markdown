Serves 8 

Preparation time: 45 minutes 

Freeze Time: At least 4 hours

### Ingredients:

• 1 graham cracker pie crust (chocolate is an acceptable alternative) - save the plastic cover

• 1 pint of ice cream - any flavor

• 1 jar of Hershey’s ice cream fudge

• 1 tub of Cool Whip

• 1 bag of Oreo cookies - smashed and divided as follows: 3⁄4 for the pie and 1⁄4 for the garnish

### Directions:

1. Have all ingredients ready, as the steps require critical timing!!

2. Allow the ice cream to get fairly soft (option to microwave approximately 20 seconds)

3. Scoop enough ice cream into the pie shell so that it is near the top – level with a spoon

4. Microwave the fudge for 20-30 seconds and stir; consistency should allow it to be scooped and easily smoothed on top of the ice cream

5. Layer over the ice cream as follows:

• Fudge

• 3⁄4 of the Oreos

• Cool Whip

• 1⁄4 of the Oreos

6. Cover with the saved plastic cover - Saran Wrap will not work; freeze a minimum of 4 hour
