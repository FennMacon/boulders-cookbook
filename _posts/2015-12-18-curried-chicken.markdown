Serves 10-12

Preparation time: 60 minutes

Ingredients:

• 6-8 cups chicken

• 3 medium Vidalia onions - chopped

• 1 quart low-fat mayonnaise

• 6-8 tablespoons curry (I use a mix of hot and mild curry powders)

• 1-2 tablespoons ginger powder

• 30 green seedless grapes - halved

• 1-2 tablespoons Major Grey chutney 

• 6-8 packets/cubes chicken bouillon

• 1 can chicken broth

• Carr’s flavored crackers/Melba Toast

Directions:

1. Cook chicken:

• Prepare a serving dish with flour, salt and pepper, ginger and curry (1/2 teaspoon each); dredge the breasts in the mix and set aside

• In a large skillet at medium high, add olive oil and a pat butter and heat up

• Add chicken and cook uncovered high for a minute

• Flip the chicken and reduce the heat to low and cover for 10 minutes - DO NOT UNCOVER

• Turn heat off and let sit an additional 10 minutes - DO NOT UNCOVER; let cool and dice

2. Sautee onions in 1 tablespoon butter; when translucent remove from heat

3. In a large saucepan, melt over medium heat: bouillon, curry, ginger, and chutney.

4. Stir and add enough chicken broth to create the consistency of mayonnaise; lower the heat to simmer and allow curry flavor to enhance for several minutes

5. Add: chicken, onions, mayonnaise and grapes and stir well

6. Cool and serve with crackers
