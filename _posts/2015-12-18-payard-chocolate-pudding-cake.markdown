Directions:

1. Cut the chocolate into fine pieces and place in a medium bowl and set aside

2. In a separate bowl, combine: milk and sugar (except that held aside)

3. In a small saucepan over medium, heat milk and stir constantly until the sugar is completely dissolved and milk begins to bubble around the edge. Remove the pan from the heat.

4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and 1 tablespoon of sugar

5. Pour half of the hot milk (step 3) in and whisk to combine

6. Return the egg mixture to the saucepan and whisk constantly until the mixture reaches 183 degrees F on an instant read thermometer.

7. Immediately pour the heated mixture over the chocolate and whisk until melted - add vanilla

8. Add the butter 1⁄2 tablespoon at a time and whisk until melted and the mixture is smooth

9. Scrape the batter into a 6” round cake pan and smooth the top with a rubber spatula

10. Cover the pan with the plastic wrap and place it in the freezer for at least 6 hours

11. 45 minutes prior to serving:

• Immerse the pan in hot water for a few seconds until it loosens from the pan

• Wipe the bottom and side of the pan dry and invert the cake onto a serving plate

• Lightly dust the top of the cake with sifted cocoa powder
