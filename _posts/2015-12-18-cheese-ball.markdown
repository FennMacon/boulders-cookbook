Refrigeration Time: 30 minutes

### Ingredients:

• 1 8 ounce package cream cheese, softened

• 1⁄4 cup sour cream

• 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese

• 1⁄2 cup chopped pecans (or pistachios)

• 1⁄4 cup of packaged dried cranberries or craisins

### Directions:

1. In a mixing bowl, combine: softened cream cheese, sour cream, shredded cheese

2. Divide cheese mix into 2 balls

3. Mix 1⁄4 cup pecans with 1⁄4 cup cranberries

4. Roll one ball of cheese in nut and berry mixture

5. Roll second ball in remaining 1⁄4 cup of pecans

6. Wrap each cheese ball in plastic wrap and let set in the fridge for about 30 minutes

Notes:

• Cheese ball in Maine was altered from original recipe because we didn’t have pistachios in the house.

• One cheese ball was made with cranberries and one was made without because Uncle Glen didn’t want cranberries in one
