Serves 4

Preparation time: 20 minutes 

Refrigeration time: At least 6 hours

Ingredients:

• 4 salmon filets

• 1 cup soy sauce

• 1⁄4 cup honey or 2 tablespoons brown sugar

• 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard

Tools:

• 1 baking dish

Directions:

1. Simmer and stir together soy sauce, honey (or brown sugar), and mustard until well combined

2. Cool and pour into a baking dish

3. Lay salmon into the dish and refrigerate for a minimum of 6 hours; marinade should be approximately 1 inch deep

4. Grill as follows:

• Bring to high heat

• Cover cooking area in tin foil (shiny side up)

• Lay filets down approximately an inch apart

• Close grill cover and DO NOT OPEN for 5 minutes

5. Remove salmon from grill when it has turned opaque and falls apart with a fork (approximately 2 more minutes)

Notes:

• For the marinade, “the longer the better is the marinating motto”; however, diminishing returns after 1 hour

• You do not have to cook the marinade. Brown sugar dissolves more easily than honey.
