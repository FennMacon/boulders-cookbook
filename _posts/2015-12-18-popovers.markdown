Ingredients:

• 3 cups milk

• 3 cups flour

• 1 tablespoon Kosher salt

• 6 eggs

• 6 ounces Gruyere cheese - grated 

• Strawberry preserves

Tools:

• 2 popover pans

• Electric mixer

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees; place both popover pans in oven to preheat

2. In a large bowl, sift the flour and salt through a sieve

3. In a small saucepan over medium high heat, warm the milk until small bubbles form around the edge and remove from heat

4. In a mixer:

• Beat the eggs until frothy – approximately 2 minutes

• Slowly add the hot milk and mix constantly so the eggs don’t cook

• Gradually add the flour mixture until almost smooth

5. Remove the popover pans and spray with non-stick vegetable spray

6. Fill 3⁄4 full of batter and sprinkle each with 1⁄2 ounce of cheese

7. Return the popover pans to the oven and:

• Bake for 15 minutes

• Bake an additional 30 minutes until the popovers are browned and puffed

8. Invert the pan and remove the popovers

9. Serve immediately with butter and strawberry preserves
