Yields one large serving bowl 

Preparation time: 30 minutes 

Cooking time: 20-30 minutes

Ingredients:

• 2 pounds firm, yellow fleshed (e.g., Yukon Gold) potatoes - scrubbed and peeled

• Coarse sea salt to taste

• 8 tablespoons unsalted butter

• 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 

• Fine sea salt to taste

• 2 tablespoons fresh flat-leaved parsley leaves – snipped with scissors

• 6 pieces well cooked bacon - chopped

Directions:

1. Place the potatoes in a large pot and fill with cold water to cover by at least an inch; add 1 tablespoon coarse sea salt for each quart of water

2. Simmer uncovered over moderate heat until a knife inserted comes away easily - 20-30 minutes

3. Drain the potatoes and transfer them to a warmed large serving bowl and dot with butter and oil

4. Add bacon and use a large fork or potato masher to coarsely crush the mixture to blend – do let it form a puree

5. Season with fine salt and parsley and serve immediately
