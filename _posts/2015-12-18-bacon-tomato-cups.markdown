Yields 30 cups 

Preparation time: 45 minutes 

Baking time: 10-15 minutes

### Ingredients:

• 30 phyllo cups (freezer section)

• 1 pound thick-cut bacon

• 3 bunches of scallions - finely chopped

• 3 or 4 plum tomatoes - chopped

• 1 or 2 yellow peppers - chopped

• 1 package shredded Swiss cheese • 1 cup mayo (start with 1⁄2 cup and see how “wet” it is - do not overdo) 

• 1 teaspoon garlic salt or powder

• 1 pinch oregano

• Cumin to taste

### Tools:

• Mini-muffin pan

### Directions:

1. Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees

2. Grease muffin pan (I don’t as the cups are easy to get out)

3. Cook bacon fairly well done

4. Crumble the bacon and mix all the ingredients together

5. Fill cups with mix

6. Bake for 10-12 minutes - should be golden

Note:

• Any leftovers should be saved and are great for scrambled eggs; this was the filling used in the scrambled eggs in “Breakfast for Dinner” in 2014.
