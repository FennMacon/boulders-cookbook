Yields 1 cup 

Preparation time: 15 minutes

Ingredients:

• 1⁄2 cup extra virgin olive oil (alternative: 1⁄2 extra-virgin and 1⁄2 regular)

• 1⁄8 cup sherry vinegar

• 1⁄8 cup lemon juice

• 2 teaspoons kosher salt

• 3 cloves garlic - pressed or chopped finely

• 5 peppercorns

• 1 tablespoon Herbs de Provence

• 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

Directions:

1. Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth or,

2. Whisk together until emulsified; if whisking, use ground pepper

Notes:

a. This makes 2:1 oil to acid dressing.

b. If you like it less vinegary, add more oil

c. Using lemon juice as part of the acid results in it being smoother; however, if pressed for time, use all vinegar
