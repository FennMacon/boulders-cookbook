### Topping ingredients:

• 1⁄2 cup all-purpose flour

• 1⁄2 cup light brown sugar

• 1⁄4 cup chopped toasted walnuts

• 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

• 1⁄2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

• 1⁄4 teaspoon kosher salt

• 1 stick of unsalted butter - chilled and cubed

### Tools:

• Rolling pin

• 9 inch pie pan

• Pie weights

### Directions – crust:

1. In a medium bowl, gently combine the flours, salt and butter

2. Place in the freezer for 5 minutes until butter is hard

3. Dump the mixture on a counter and roll over it quickly with a rolling pin (scrape whatever adheres to the pin)

4. Repeat this rolling 2-3 times until the butter forms flat flakes

5. Scrape the mixture back into the bowl and add the shortening in chickpea size lumps

6. Freeze 5 more minutes

7. Dump the mixture on the counter and roll and scrape 2 more times to incorporate shortening

8. Return to bowl and freeze 5 more minutes

9. Add water/vinegar mixture to the bowl; toss with a fork

10. Press a few tablespoons of the mixture in your hand; if it clumps, you are ok; if it crumbles, add ice water a teaspoon at a time until it does clump

11. Dump onto the counter and bring together with your hands; knead only once or twice to just form a mass that sticks together

12. Divide into 2 flat round balls - one slightly larger than the other

13. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before rolling

14. Roll the crust into a 3⁄8 inch thick round on either a lightly floured surface or between two sheets of plastic wrap

15. Line a 9 inch pie pan with the dough, use your thumb or forefinger to crimp the edges

16. Chill no more than 1 day - if required

### Directions – filling:

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees

2. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and combine: raisins, rum, and 1/3 cup of water. Stir in the brown sugar and bring to a boil. Simmer and stir occasionally until the sugar is dissolved and then remove from heat and let cool.

3. In a large bowl, combine: apples, pears, cranberries, granulated sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and salt. Add the cooled raisin mixture and toss well to combine. Allow this mixture to rest at room temperature as crust is baked.

4. Line the crust with foil, pie weights and place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake the crust for approximately 20 minutes until it is a light golden brown. Remove the foil and weights.

5. Scrape the fruit mixture into the crust - pile the fruit into a mound in the center so it does not spill out. Return the pie to the oven and bake for another 30 minutes.

6. In a medium bowl, combine all of the topping ingredients with the exception of the butter. Rub the butter into the flour mixture until large crumbs form.

7. Remove the pie and sprinkle the crumb topping over the filling

8. Return the pie to the oven and bake for another 30-35 minutes until the juices are bubbling (Check the pie after 20 minutes, if crumbs look too brown, tent the pie with a sheet of foil

9. Allow the pie to cool for 25-30 minutes on a wire rack before serving
