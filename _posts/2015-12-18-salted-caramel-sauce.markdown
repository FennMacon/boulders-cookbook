Yields approximately 1 cup 

Preparation time: 20 minutes

Ingredients:

• 1 cup sugar

• 1⁄2 cup heavy cream

• 3 ounces butter - chunked

• 1⁄2 teaspoon sea salt crushed in your fingers

• 1⁄2 cup water (optional but recommended for caramel beginners)

Tools:

• Heavy-bottomed saucepan

Directions:

1. In the saucepan, heat sugar and water over medium heat - do not stir! Wait until at least 70 percent of the sugar is melted, give the pan a shake and stir with a metal whisk

2. Once completely dissolved, the color should be deep brown/dark amber with smoke just starting to appear. Remove from heat and begin adding butter a chunk at a time - stir in completely before adding the next chunk

3. Add the cream and stir into the mixture; then add the sea salt

4. Serve with ice cream, over Noni Macon’s brownies or with Crème Anglaise over berries

Note:

• Ideally this is prepared with a partner and “Fenn is available by appointment.”
