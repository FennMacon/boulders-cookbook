Serves 4

Preparation time: 2 hours

Ingredients:

• 5 pounds whole chicken legs

• 6 cloves garlic - minced (about 4 tablespoons)

• 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary

• 1 tablespoon kosher salt

• 1⁄2 teaspoon cracked black pepper

• 1 tablespoon olive oil

• Very large pinch of Noni’s marinated onions

• 1 cup white wine

• 2 plum tomatoes - diced (about 1 cup)

• Very large pinch of Noni’s caramelized onions

• 1⁄2 cup chicken stock

• 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 

• Pinch fresh basil - chiffonade

• Pinch fresh parsley - chiffonade 

• 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

• 2 6 inch torpedo rolls - halved lengthwise

• Shaved cheese for garnish, e.g., Asiago, Parmesan

• 2 handfuls romaine lettuce - coarsely torn - optional

• 2 tablespoons Caesar dressing

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees

2. Make a rub for the chicken by combining garlic, salt, pepper, herbs de Provence and rosemary in a food processor and pulsing until pureed.

3. Place the chicken in a roasting pan and rub all over with the garlic puree. Make sure to place some under the skin.

4. Place the pan on the bottom oven rack and roast for 45 minutes - skin should be brown and crisp and, when pierced with a fork, juice should be clear. Let meat cool. Chicken may be prepared in advance.

5. When cool, debone the meat and set aside

6. In the pan in which the chicken was roasted, heat the oil over medium-high heat and add the marinated onions

7. Sauté the mixture for 5 minutes or until the onions are lightly toasted

8. Add the chicken and the white wine; bring to a boil and cook for 30 seconds or until deglazed

9. Add the tomatoes, caramelized onions, chicken stock and vinegar and bring to a boil

10. Decrease the heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes until the liquid is reduced

11. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, basil and parsley; correct the seasonings if desired, adding more balsamic vinegar to taste

12. Assemble the sandwiches by dividing the mixture over the rolls and garnishing with cheese; slice in half and serve immediately

Note:

• For a chicken Caesar sandwich, place a small bed of romaine lettuce inside the roll and drizzle with a portion of the dressing and then top with the chicken mixture
